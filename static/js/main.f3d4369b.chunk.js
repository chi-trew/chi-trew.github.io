The workshop will provide a venue to explore three broad aspects related to human-AI trust: (1) How do we clarify definitions and frameworks relevant to human-AI trust and reliance (e.g., what does trust mean in different contexts)? (2) How do we measure trust and reliance? And, (3) How do we shape trust and reliance?

As AI becomes more sophisticated, it becomes difficult to determine where the AI interaction ends and the human interaction begins. This makes it difficult to determine who or what we are trusting, and who or what is controlling these interactions and influencing trust. I discuss three themes to establish a better understanding of trust in AI: blurring boundaries as AI moves from tool to teammate; challenges in defining and aligning goals; and the difference between trust in AI and trusting AI. These themes suggest new approaches for measuring and managing trust. Ongoing challenges include understanding how adapt these approaches to different contexts and populations."},{start:"10:20",end:"10:55",title:"Paper Session 1: Frameworks & Measuring Trust and Reliance",sessionId:0,leader:"Simone Stumpf",format:"Virtual (pre-recorded), slack Q&A",type:"paper"},{start:"10:55",end:"11:15",title:"Coffee break",format:"",type:"break"},{start:"11:15",end:"11:50",sessionId:1,title:"Paper Session 2: Factors and Strategies for Shaping Trust and Reliance",leader:"Sherry Tongshuang Wu",format:"Virtual (pre-recorded), slack Q&A",type:"paper"},{start:"11:50",end:"12:30",sessionId:2,title:"Paper Session 3: Understanding User Needs and New Perspectives for Trust and Reliance",leader:"Gagan Bansal",format:"Virtual (pre-recorded), slack Q&A",type:"paper"},{start:"12:30",end:"14:00",title:"Lunch",format:"on your own",type:"break"},{start:"14:00",end:"15:00",title:"Group activity 1 (40 min) + Results (20 mins)",leader:"Kenneth Holstein and Zana Bu\xe7inca",format:"Hybrid",type:"group"},{start:"15:00",end:"15:45",title:"Group activity 2 (30 min) + Results (15 mins)",leader:"Kenneth Holstein and Zana Bu\xe7inca",format:"Hybrid",type:"group"},{start:"15:45",end:"16:00",title:"Coffee break",format:"",type:"break"},{start:"16:00",end:"16:45",title:"Panel",leader:"Jessica Hullman",format:"Virtual (live)",type:"panel",description:"With Saleema Amershi, Maria De-Arteaga, Krzystof Gajos, and Tim Miller"},{start:"16:45",end:"17:00",title:"Closing remarks",leader:"Gagan Bansal and Alison Smith-Renner",format:"Virtual (live)",type:"break"}],speakers:[{name:"John D.
