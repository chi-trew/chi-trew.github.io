      <p>
        State-of-the-art AIs, including Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4,
        now possess the capabilities once unique to humans, such as coding, idea
        generation, and planning. These advanced AIs are now integrated into a
        plethora of platforms and tools, including GitHub Copilot, Bing Chat,
        Bard, ChatGPT, and Advanced Data Analytics. In contrast to conventional,
        specialized AIs that typically offer singular solutions, these LLMs
        redefine human-AI dynamics. Instead of perceiving AIs merely as
        supportive tools, there's a growing trend where humans view them as
        collaborative counterparts. This shift leads to enhanced dialogues,
        negotiations, and task delegation between humans and AI. With these
        rapid advancements, the nature of human roles in the AI collaboration
        spectrum is evolving. While our{" "}
        <a href="https://chi-trait.github.io/#/">
          previous workshops like CHI TRAIT 2022 and 2023
        </a>{" "}
        delved into the trust and reliance concerning traditional AIs, the
        pressing question now is: how should humans gauge trust and reliance
        with these emerging AI technologies? As these systems witness widespread
        adoption, there's also a need to assess their impact on human skill
        development. Does AI assistance amplify human skill progression, or does
        it inadvertently inhibit it? Considering the multifaceted challenges and
        solutions that revolve around human-AI interactions, we invite experts
        from diverse fields, including HCI, AI, ML, psychology, and social
        science. Our aim is to bridge communication gaps and facilitate rich
        collaborations across these domains. Formerly the workshop on{" "}
        <i>Trust and Reliance in AI-Human Teams</i>, this sequel workshop aims
        to{" "}
        <b className="text-highlight">
          revisit the topic of trust and reliance in in the evolving context of
          human-AI collaboration in the age of LLMs.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, in this new context, we want to synthesize and
        conceptualize:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          How the AI roles change, and how the user roles have changed with
          these new AI;
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether and how trust and reliance definitions and measures should be
          changed;
        </li>
        <li>
          The impact of these new interactions on users, especially their
          individual skills and learning
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As these problems and solutions involving humansand AI are
        interdisciplinary in nature, we invite participants with expertise in
        HCI, AI, ML, psychology, and social science, or otherrelevant fields to
        foster closer communications and collaboration between multiple
        communities.

        State-of-the-art AIs and LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) can now perform tasks
        previously exclusive to humans (e.g., writing code, generating ideas,
        planning), and are being widely used in various domains, applications,
        and commercial tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Bing Chat, Bard, ChatGPT,
        Advanced Data Analytics, etc). Compared to more traditional forms of
        specialized AI, these LLMs introduce new dynamics to human-AI
        interaction. For example, instead of simply trusting and depending on AI
        models as supportive tools that offer single-shot suggestions, humans
        may increasingly come to rely on AIs as <b>collaborative peers</b> and
        engage in dialogs and negotiations, delegate various tasks. Given these
        impressive capabilities and evolving landscape of LLMs, what will the
        new human roles in human-AI collaboration become? how will we adopt and
        rely on these models differently? As these systems move to large-scale
        adoption, how will people's skills on the task be impacted? Will AI
        assistance help or hinder people's skill improvement over time?
      </p>
      <p>
        This workshop will provide a venue for exploring how the collaboration
        between humans and AIs evolve, and how humans' trust and reliance on AIs
        evolve accordingly. We invite participants with expertise in HCI, AI,
        ML, psychology, and social science, or other relevant fields to come
        together and discuss three themes: (1) What should be the new roles of
        humans and AIs when the latter are so versatile? (2) How should we
        define and measure trust and reliance in these new contexts? (3) What
        are the long term impact of such human-AI collaboration on each other?
