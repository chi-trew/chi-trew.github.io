How proxy outcomes limit measurement of appropriate reliance in AI-assisted decision-making,long,"introduces (1) the concept of outcome measurement error as the gap between the human’s goal and the AI’s objective in AI-assisted decision-making, and (2) a framework for characterizing it.",,
factors and strategies,strategies (supporting validation),47,Jordan Huffaker and Sai Gouravajhala,Shaping Trust in Machine Translation Suggestions Through AI-Assisted Context Building,long,"proposes the notion of ""context building,"" or the idea of bringing in additional context relevant to an AI's output. This context is used to help people assess, validate, and/or correct a model's output. The work is motivated by the observation that human collaborators often turn to external resources to help validate model output for tasks such as machine-assisted translation (e.g., English to French).",,
